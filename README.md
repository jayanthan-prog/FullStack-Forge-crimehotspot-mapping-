CrimeHotspotMapping
Project Overview
The CrimeHotspotMapping project aims to develop an advanced crime analysis and prediction system that leverages data to identify and monitor crime hotspots within a city. The system will analyze various sources of data, including distress call records and historical crime data, to identify patterns in crime frequency, type, time of occurrence, and geographic location. By doing so, the tool will provide valuable insights to law enforcement agencies, enabling them to allocate resources more effectively and implement proactive strategies for crime prevention.
